# Original Data Visualisation on World Happiness Report(WHR) 2021 - 2023
The data visualization we have chosen is Table 2.2 from the World Happiness Report (WHR) (Figure 1), which shows the ranking of life evaluations for four age groups: "The Young," "Lower Middle," "Upper Middle," and "The Old," from 2021 to 2023.

This visualization is significant because it highlights the perception of happiness in each country by demographic age group. It can be used to learn about the factors and geographical influences affecting each country, helping us understand how to maximize overall happiness.

Despite being clear and easy to read, the visualization has some limitations. Firstly, the missing scores for each age group make it difficult for users to understand the magnitude of the differences in scores and identify trends and patterns in the data. Additionally, the table format requires users to scan through the entire table to identify changes in scores over time, making it challenging to see trends and patterns easily. Therefore, we propose the following improvements to address the weaknesses of the original visualization:

1) Include the actual scores for each age group to provide a clearer understanding of the differences in scores.
2) Use a different formats, such as a line graph or bar chart, to make it easier to identify trends and patterns over time.

3) Create an interactive data visualization that allows users to explore the data in more detail.
These changes aim to enhance the clarity and usefulness of the data visualization, making it more effective for analyzing and interpreting the data.

# Critical Assessment and Strength & Weaknesses
Summarize the teamâ€™s critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the original visualization.
Describe any improvements you intend to incorporate.

## Strengths
For users who are interested in getting a quick answer which, the table format is easy to read and understand. The data is presented in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to compare the life evaluation scores of different age groups across three years. The use of color coding also helps to highlight the differences in scores, making it easier for users to identify trends and patterns in the data.

## Weaknesses
As the data only shows the ranking of life evaluation of age group from 2021 to 2023, it is difficult to see the actual scores of each age group. This makes it hard for users to understand the magnitude of the differences in scores between age groups. The table format also makes it difficult to see the trends and patterns in the data, as users have to scan through the entire table to identify changes in scores over time.
 
Furthermore, for the label for "Happiest" and "Least Happy" is also not quantified, and does not show the disparity of the scores between the age groups.

Lastly, the data has very extensive amounts of data. It is hard to see the trends and patterns in the data, as users have to scan through the entire table to identify changes in scores over time.

# Proposed Improvements
To address the weaknesses of the original data visualisation, we propose the following improvements:

## Using of scores 
Instead of only showing ranking, we intend to include scores of each age group in the data visualisation. This will provide users with a better understanding of the magnitude of the differences in scores between age groups and allow them to see the actual scores of each age group. By including scores, users will be able to compare the life evaluation scores of different age groups more accurately and make more informed decisions based on the data.

## Lineplots
To further give our users a better understanding of the trends and patterns in the data, we will use line plots to visualise the data of each country. Line plots are effective in showing trends over time and will allow users to see how the life evaluation scores of different age groups change from 2021 to 2023. By using line plots, users will be able to identify patterns in the data more easily and make more informed decisions based on the data.

## Interactive Data Visualisation

We will create an interactive data visualisation that allows users to explore the data in more detail. Users will be able to hover over the data points to see the actual scores of each age group and compare the scores across different years. The interactive data visualisation will also include filters that allow users to focus on specific age groups or years, making it easier to identify trends and patterns in the data.
