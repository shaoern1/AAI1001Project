# Original Data Visualisation on World Happiness Report(WHR) 2021 - 2023

The data visualization we have chosen is Table 2.2 from the World Happiness Report (WHR) (Figure 1), which shows the ranking of 156 countries based on how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be.

This visualization is significant because it highlights the perception of happiness in each country based on the relevant factors which includes the GDP per Capita, Social Support provided, level of Freedom, Generosity of the country and Life Expectancy of the population. It can be used to learn about the factors and geographical influences affecting each country, helping us understand how to maximize overall happiness.

# Critical Assessment and Strength & Weaknesses

Summarize the teamâ€™s critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the original visualization. Describe any improvements you intend to incorporate.

## Strengths

As you select between the different tabs at the top, the dots on the scatter chart will shift around, allowing viewers to easily see how each factor could potentially affect the level on the happiness index.

Although it is messy, each dot is also separated based on the continent that each country resides in. It may still not be the most efficient way to search for a specific country but it does help to narrow down the list of countries that are displayed. It also helps to show roughly which continents are thriving more than others in the happiness department.

## Weaknesses

This data is only based on data received in 2019. There is no way to view potential trends of growing or shrinking happiness levels within countries over the course of a few years.

The data also faces the issue of some dots being difficult to view as the size of the dots is determined by the population size of each country. Countries such as Singapore have very small dots which not only make them difficult to locate but also mouse over.

The data also faces the issue of overlapping dots. Bigger dots on the chart may completely cover smaller dots and in some cases viewers are not able to view those dots that are being covered completely.

The chart can also be misleading as when the population size of a country is bigger, the dot for that country could be seen as higher than smaller dots on the y-axis. For example, China is ranked number 93 while Algeria is ranked number 88 but due to China's large population size, it looks as if it has a higher happiness index than Algeria.

# Proposed Improvements

To address the weaknesses of the original data visualisation, we propose the following improvements:

## Using of scores

Instead of only showing ranking, we intend to include scores of each age group in the data visualisation. This will provide users with a better understanding of the magnitude of the differences in scores between age groups and allow them to see the actual scores of each age group. By including scores, users will be able to compare the life evaluation scores of different age groups more accurately and make more informed decisions based on the data.

## Lineplots

To further give our users a better understanding of the trends and patterns in the data, we will use line plots to visualise the data of each country. Line plots are effective in showing trends over time and will allow users to see how the life evaluation scores change from 2021 to 2023. By using line plots, users will be able to identify patterns in the data more easily and make more informed decisions based on the data.

## Interactive Data Visualisation

We will create an interactive data visualisation that allows users to explore the data in more detail. Users will be able to hover over the data points to see the actual scores of each age group and compare the scores across different years. The interactive data visualisation will also include filters that allow users to focus on specific countries, making it easier to identify trends and patterns in the data.
