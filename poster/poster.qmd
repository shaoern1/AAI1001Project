# Introduction

## Global Happiness Score

The Life Ladder score, also known as the World Happiness Score, is derived from the Gallup World Poll data. The score is typically calculated based on several key variables that reflect the well-being and quality of life in different countries. Hereâ€™s a general outline of the formula and components involved in calculating the World Happiness Score:

| **Component** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Life Evaluations (Ladder Question) | Respondents rate their current life from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). |
| GDP per Capita | Natural logarithm of GDP per capita (PPP terms). |
| Social Support | Binary response to: "Do you have relatives or friends you can count on for help if needed?" |
| Healthy Life Expectancy | Life expectancy at birth.|
| Freedom to Make Life Choices | Binary response to: "Are you satisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?" |
| Generosity | Donations to charity in the past month, adjusted for GDP per capita |
| Perceptions of Corruption | Perceived corruption in government and business. |
| Positive and Negative Affect | Average responses to questions about recent experiences of positive and negative emotions (e.g., laughter, enjoyment, sadness, and anger). |

The World Happiness Score is calculated using a regression model that combines these variables to predict the happiness score for each country.

## Visualcapitalist's Global Happiness Levels Previous Visualisation

The following @fig-Visualcapitalist-map from [Visualcapitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/a-map-of-global-happiness-by-country-in-2024/) presents the global happiness levels in 2024, as reported in the **World Happiness Report** ([WHR](https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/WHR+24.pdf)). The static world map provides a visual representation of the happiness scores across different countries, with the color gradient indicating the relative happiness levels. The visualization aims to highlight the disparities in happiness levels worldwide and the factors that contribute to these variations. However, through our critical analysis, we identified several strengths and weaknesses in the original visualization that we aim to improve as detailed below.

## Create violin plot

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Calculate mean score for each region and sort regions by mean score in ascending order
region_order <- df_combined %>%
  group_by(`World Region according to the World Bank`) %>%
  summarize(mean_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(mean_score) %>%
  pull(`World Region according to the World Bank`)

# Convert the 'World Region according to the World Bank' column to a factor with the sorted order
df_combined$`World Region according to the World Bank` <- factor(df_combined$`World Region according to the World Bank`, levels = region_order)

# Base plot
base_plot <- ggplot(df_combined, aes(y = `World Region according to the World Bank`, x = score)) +
  geom_violin(trim = TRUE, fill = "lightblue") +  # Create horizontal violin plots with single color

    plot.margin = margin(t = 10, r = 10, b = 40, l = 10)
  ) 

# Highlight the top and bottom of each region with text labels of the respective country
highlight_data <- df_combined %>%

# Add the highlighted points and text labels to the base plot
final_plot <- base_plot +

## Distribution Chart of Scores
